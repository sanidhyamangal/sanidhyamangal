### Hi there 👋

I'm Sanidhya, currently work on intersection of Computer Vision,Web and Medical-Image Processing, trying to prophesy using data. Lately, I am enjoying playing with GANs for generation of synthetic data.

- 👨🏻‍💻 I've been contributing to open source for a while, mostly about some ML model implementation. 
- ✍🏻 Author of following research articles
  - [LSTM vs. GRU vs. Bidirectional RNN for script generation](https://arxiv.org/abs/1908.04332) - for scripts using seq-to-seq models  
  - [LSTM Based Music Generation System](https://arxiv.org/abs/1908.01080) - for generating ballads using shallow LSTM
  - [Convolution Neural Networks for diagnosing colon and lung cancer histopathological images](https://arxiv.org/abs/2009.03878) - for diagnosing colon and lung caancer using histopathological images.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning about deep generative models, transformers and kubeflow
- 📫 Feel to reach out to me on <mangalsanidhya19@gmail.com> for work related queries.
