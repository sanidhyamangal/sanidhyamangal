### Hi there 👋

I’m a Data Scientist who’s super passionate about bridging the gap between real-world solutions for GenAI techniques and their actual implementation. I’ve been working mostly in the healthcare space, where I’ve developed solutions to tackle a variety of problems, like identifying payment integrity violations for healthcare claims, creating agents that can summarize claims data, and even hosting Q&A sessions on these claims. When I’m not busy developing agents to take over the world, you can usually find me in a cozy little café, wearing a conessuir hat, trying to figure out which coffee blend to try next while getting lost in a good book.

- 👨🏻‍💻 I've been contributing to open source for a while, mostly about some ML model implementation.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning about deep generative models, transformers and different MLOps tools.
- 📫 Feel to reach out to me on <mangalsanidhya19@gmail.com> for work related queries.
